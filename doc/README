When you start mysql for the first time, you're recommended to harden the
installation by removing the anon users and deleting test tables. Go ahead and

Copy the potato package to /var/www/html

Make configuration changes in config.php, db_schema.sql (change the
password)

import the database schema by issuing the command:
