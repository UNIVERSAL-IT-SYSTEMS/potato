SELinux is unsupported. There's a custom policy that needs to be written for SELinux to work properly with potato. It's on my todo list.

When you start mysql for the first time, you're recommended to harden the
installation by removing the anon users and deleting test tables. Go ahead and
do that.

Copy the potato package to /var/www/html

Make configuration changes in config.php, db_schema.sql (change the
password)

Create the potato database by issuing the following commands at the mysql prompt:
> create database `potato` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
> grant ALL on potato.* to potato@localhost identified by "SuperSecret99";
> flush privileges;

Update your config.php with the appropriate database name, username, and password. 
Next, visit the page install.php in your potato installation, and follow any on-screen
instructions.

You should now be able to log into the web interface, register tokens and
pins. You should also be able to verify the token functionality from the web
interface.

Make sure everything works before proceeding to the next step

Edit the /etc/raddb/users file to your needs. There's a super-simple sample in doc/users that can be used.

Copy the file doc/potato to /etc/raddb/modules, and add "potato" to the authorize section of /etc/raddb/sites-available/default
