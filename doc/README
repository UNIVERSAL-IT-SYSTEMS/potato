SELinux is unsupported. There's a custom policy that needs to be written for SELinux to work properly with potato. It's on my todo list.

When you start mysql for the first time, you're recommended to harden the
installation by removing the anon users and deleting test tables. Go ahead and
do that.

Unpack the potato package in /var/www/html

Update your config.php with the appropriate database name, username, and password, 
along with any other relevant configuration. Next, using a web browser, visit the 
page install.php in your potato installation, and follow any on-screen instructions.

You should now be able to log into the web interface, register tokens and
pins. You should also be able to verify the token functionality from the web
interface.

Make sure everything works before proceeding to the next step

FreeRadius

enter /etc/raddb/cert and execute "./bootstrap" as the radius user

Edit the /etc/raddb/users file to your needs. There's a super-simple sample in doc/users that can be used.

Add the following section to the authorize section (just after the "files" directive) of /etc/raddb/sites-available/default:

	if (!"%{control:Cleartext-Password}") {
		update control {
			Cleartext-Password := `/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/potato/radauth.php -u %{User-Name} -p %{User-Password} -s %{Client-Shortname} -c %{Calling-Station-Id}`
		}
	}
