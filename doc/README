When you start mysql for the first time, you're recommended to harden the
installation by removing the anon users and deleting test tables. Go ahead and
do that.

Copy the potato package to /var/www/html

Make configuration changes in config.php, db_schema.sql (change the
password)

import the database schema by issuing the command:
mysql -u root -p < db_schema.sql

pins. You should also be able to verify the token functionality from the web
interface.

Make sure everything works before proceeding to the next step
